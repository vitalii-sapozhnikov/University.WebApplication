features of the university's subject area in the environment of the I. I. Mechnikov
ONU, identifies the functionality that needs to be implemented, and collects user
requirements.

A database scheme was designed. A three-tier system architecture and MVC
design pattern were chosen. A technology stack was selected for development:
Postgres DBMS, ASP .NET Core platform for the server side and HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, Bootstrap library for the client interface. User interaction with the
